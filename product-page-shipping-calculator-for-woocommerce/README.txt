This plugin allows you to show shipping methods available on the product page for WooCommerce. So customer can see if shipping is available to his location and at what cost 

== Description ==

&#9989; Allow your customer to **calculate shipping** before adding product to the cart.

&#9989; Check **available shipping methods** to your area

&#9989; Customer can know if the **product can be shipped to their location or not**, so they don't have to go to checkout page to find out that you don't ship to their area

&#9989; Plugin show the available shipping method even when customer has not added his address, plugin show the method based on the shipping zone assigned to customer by WooCommerce

&#9989; He can **change the delivery location** and he can see the changed cost and shipping method available for that particular location

&#9989; All the **calculation is done on Ajax** so no page reload is needed, and page caching will not affect it as well

&#9989; **Change the position** of the calculator on product page to be above add to cart button or below add to cart button

&#9989; **[pi_shipping_calculator]** If auto insertion is not working for you or there is some other issue in the auto inserted position, in such case you can enable the shortcode option and insert it by shortcode [pi_shipping_calculator] on product page. To enable the shortcode option go to **Basic Setting > Position of the calculator on product page > Insert by shortcode [pi_shipping_calculator]**

&#9989; It supports **WPML and Polylang**

&#9989; Disable **auto loading** of the shipping method 

&#9989; Select different **position for the result** from the given 3 positions

&#9989; Disable shipping calculator on specific product

&#9989; Remove state field from the calculator form or address form, do this only if your shipping zones are not dependent on the state

&#9989; Remove city field from the calculator form or address form

&#9989; Remove postcode field, do this only if your shipping zones are not dependent on the postcode 

&#9989; **Remove country** field from the calculator form or address form **(only works when you Ship to a single country)**

&#9989; Consider the quantity user has added in the Quantity field on the product page, and show shipping charge as per that quantity. (Consider quantity option is disabled by default so you need to enable it)
When this option is enabled:

`
When product A is not in cart = shipping will be shown as per the quantity set in the quantity field
    
When product A is present in the cart  = Shipping will be shown as per the quantity set in the quantity field plus the quantity present in the Cart
`

&#9989; You can configure the plugin to show the shipping cost of the product customer is checking, ignoring the shipping cost of other products in the cart. This is useful when you have a product that has a different shipping cost than other products in the cart.

&#9989; This plugin is compatible with our [PRO Estimate delivery date plugin](https://www.piwebsolution.com/product/pro-estimate-delivery-date-for-woocommerce/?utm_source=product-page-shipping-calculator-description&utm_medium=display&utm_campaign=product-page-shipping-calculator), so you can show estimated delivery date for each of the shipping methods 

&#9989; Show the location selection box inside a popup

&#9989; Enable the option of "Load user location data by Ajax to avoid page caching" to make the calculator work properly when you have page caching enabled on the product page (you will find this option under Basic setting tab)

&#9989; Working of the popup: 

Use to get location = In this mode the form is only used to get the user location in the popup
    
Show if shipping is available  = In this mode the popup is used to take the location and also show the message whether shipping is available to that location or not.

For the plugin to show a "shipping is available" message there should be a shipping zone present with a shipping method. If there is no shipping zone available matching the user location or if there is a zone but there is no shipping method then it will return the message "No shipping available for the location." 

Show if shipping is available based and also show shipping methods = In this mode it will show the message plus all the shipping method available in that zone

&#9989; You can add the address insertion form by shortcode as well [pi_address_form]

&#9989; You can check if shipping or delivery is available in particular postcode/zip-code or not

&#9989; Use our PRO Estimate date and time plugin along with this plugin to show estimated delivery date for the customer location

&#9989; [Compatible with WPML](https://wpml.org/plugin/product-page-shipping-calculator-for-woocommerce/)
